Write a shell script for making a command for the following functionalities
myp -1 sourcefolder
myp -2 sourcefolder1 sourcefolder2 destinationfolder

In functionality 1, let there be a source folder containing multiple
files. The file names in the source folder should be appended with the 
size of the files. 
For example, let there be  a sourcefolder containing a file abc.txt with
the size 450 bytes. The name of the resulting file should be abc450.txt, and so on.

In the second functionality, files with uncommon names in source folder 1 
and source folder 2 should be copied to the destination folder.
For example, let there be two files xyz.dat, pqr.dat in soucrefolder1 and 
files xyz.dat, def.dat in sourcefolder2. The files pqr.dat and def.dat should be copied 
to destinationfolder.
